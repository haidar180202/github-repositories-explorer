GitHub Repositories Explorer is a web application that allows users to search and explore GitHub repositories by username. With a simple and inspiring interface, users can easily find relevant repositories and get detailed information about each repository.then the implementation with react typescript with vite.


### Prerequisites

  - Windows or macOS:
    [Install Node js Desktop](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

- Download or see this [data](https://) and create the app like this.

### Installation Running a sample

After you install Node js, run the file that you installed until the file that is installed is complete and check with:

```
node --version
```
or
```
node -v
```

After this you can clone myproject app with
